# Data
* The data that was used in this analysis it Citi_Bike data in New York City in the months of January, July, and November for the year of 2020.

# The Average Trip Duration by Age
## Sheet 1

The data shows that throughout the year of 2020 there are 3 peak ages in which people of those ages on average took those trips. The peaks inlcude the birth years of 1949, 1969, and 2002. Other than those three peaks the data seems to show little change in the differences between the other birth years. 

# How Variable is the Utilization by Bike ID
## Sheet 2

There is no pattern to which how the bikes are used and that it is random with the usage. This is implies because of the variablility of the data per the Bike ID usage. 

# All Bike Stations with a Visual Indication of the Most Popular Locations to Start a Journey
## Sheet 3

There is a cluster of stations that seem to be used the most and the farther you get away from the cluster the less usage the stations get. Although there are a few stations that may be outliers. 

# Top 10 Stations to Start and End a Journey
## Sheet 4 (end)
These may be the Top 10 stations in the city for starting a Journey becaue it may be a highly populated area, thus, being easily accessible.

## Sheet 5 (start)
These may be the Top 10 stations in the city to end a journey becauase there may be sight seeing opportunities in which many would like to stop by. 

# Bottom 10 Stations to Start and End a Journey
## Sheet 6 (start)
These may be the Bottom 10 stations in the city for starting because they may be near smaller hubs and site seeing in the city
## Sheet 7 (end)
These may be the bottom 10 to end becuase they are a point in which its close to somebodies home rather than an site seeing location so many probably do not go there. 

# How Many Trips Have Been Recorded Total
## Sheet 8 
 
Includes all trips that were taken from Station A to Station B

# Gender Breakdown of Active Participants
## Sheet 9
It seems to be the most active partipants are male, however, it is important to note that the unknown genders can effect this data if we were to have that infromation. 
* Gender Variables: 0 = unknown, 1 = male, 2 = female


# Bikes (by ID) are Most Likely Due for Repair or Inspection
## Sheet 10
There are a fair share of bikes that are over a count of 100 trips. Though the trip duration was not taken into consideration which could adjust the data in which bikes may need repair or inspection

# The Peak Hours in Which Bikes are Used During the Dated Months
# Sheet 11
In the morning around 8am and late afternoon around 6pm it seems are peak hours. 8am is a general time for work hours to start and 6om is also a general time for work hours to close. Thus you can assume that people uses Citi Bikes as a way of transpertation.
